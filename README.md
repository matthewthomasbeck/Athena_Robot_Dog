Project Athena!

Creator(s):

Hi, my name is Matthew Beck, and I am responsible for writing specifically the code for this robot dog. Other extremely important controbutors to this project as a whole are Omar Ferrer,
a fellow software engineer who helped me create the environemnt (wouldn't have been able to do it without him tbh) that allowed me to do this in the first place, and Aaed Musa, the
mechanical enigeer responsible fot the Ares robotic dog platform, which has given me the luxury to focus on software and not engineering.

Purpose:

Software Engineering has an uneasy future ahead of it, and I wanted to make sure I had sharp skills in a way that ensured said stills wouldn't immediately be replaced by A.I. (my thought
process being that though it's not impossible for a roboticist to be replaced by A.I., it's probably going to be a lot harder to replace me as copmpated to if I chose to make apps and
whatnot; sorry if I am accidentally throwing shade to some people, it's just my truth).

This robot dog is meant to provide me a stepping stone of which I can move onto other projects such as:

* more advanced ML models
* controlling the robot via the internet
* more advanced robot dogs

Hopefully these things pan out, we'll see.

How you can help:

If you like it, STAR IT!!! I am a uni student right now, but I've got to start preparing to get hired, and so any help would mean the world.
